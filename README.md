## AIM
To evaluate and compare the effectiveness of prompting techniques (zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought, role-based) across different AI platforms (e.g., ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, Copilot) in a specific task: text summarization.

## Scenario:
You are part of a content curation team for an educational platform that delivers quick summaries of research papers to undergraduate students. Your task is to summarize a 500-word technical article on "The Basics of Blockchain Technology" using multiple AI platforms and prompting strategies.

Your goal is to determine which combination of prompting technique + platform provides the best summary in terms of:

Accuracy

Coherence

Simplicity

Speed

User experience

## Algorithm

1. **Define Use Case**  
   Identify a realistic personalization scenario (e.g., product recommendations based on user behavior).

2. **Select Prompt Types**  
   Choose three distinct prompting strategies:  
   - Straightforward Prompt  
   - Tabular Format Prompt  
   - Missing Word Prompt  

3. **Design Prompts**  
   Write specific prompt examples aligned with the use case for each strategy.

4. **Submit to Platforms**  
   Run each prompt through two different AI platforms (ChatGPT and Claude).

5. **Collect Outputs**  
   Record the responses generated by each platform.

6. **Evaluate Criteria**  
   Assess each output based on:  
   - Relevance  
   - Coherence  
   - Customization Depth  
   - Responsiveness  
   - Tone

7. **Compare and Recommend**  
   Identify the best-performing combinations and suggest practical applications.
